# logistic-regression
Used a Titanic dataset to determine the survivability of passengers based on various factors

Process to build a logistic regression model:
1. Explore the dataset to determine the target variable
2. Clean the data
3. Convert all categorical feature variables into dummy variables
4. Partition the data into training and testing datasets
5. Fit the training data into a logistic regression model

Testing the model:
1. Predict the outcomes with the testing set
2. Display the accuracy for the predictions for survivability
3. Plot a confusion matrix
4. Display the predicted value and probability given a set of features
